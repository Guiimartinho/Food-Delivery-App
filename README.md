# Food-Delivery-App

Runs on a custom isomorphic framework making use of heavy regexing, parsing templates, updating page's state and its components, routing, fake Promisesâ€™ helper functions etc.

Features
We had the admin interface where he/she sat to preside over the staff, the food orders, foods available for the day, some more foods always on standby, their prices and general info about them, then an inbuilt chat client for nudging (think poking, with one of those cooking knives) staff that haven't assigned a particular order to themselves yet. Which probably means staff need to have both a central location to view orders, and customizable pages to participate in intra-communication amongst each other.
